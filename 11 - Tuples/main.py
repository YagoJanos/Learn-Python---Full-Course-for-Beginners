#A tuple has a few key differences from lists
#A tuple is immutable

coordinates = (4, 5)
print(coordinates[0])
print(coordinates[1])

#coordinates[1] = 0 will give us an error cause we can't change a tuple
#In practical use cases generally people will use tuples for data
#that is never going to change
